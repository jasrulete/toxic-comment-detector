# AI-Assisted Toxic Comment Detection

This project is a machine learning-based system that detects toxic and non-toxic comments using natural language processing techniques. It is designed as an assistive tool to support content moderation and promote safer online interactions.

## Features
- Binary classification (toxic vs non-toxic)
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, noise removal)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models
- Real-time predictions using Streamlit

## Dataset
This project uses the **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification** dataset from Kaggle.
